# Scrooge
Taxi Price comparison App for the course App Studio at the University of Amsterdam

##Features
* Compare prices/travelling times of a taxi ride using API's of different taxi companies.

##Frameworks
* I would like to use an API from google to show a map and check current position for taxi pick-up.
* Found awesome library called Ion that handles a lot of the nasty Java/Android networking stuff.
